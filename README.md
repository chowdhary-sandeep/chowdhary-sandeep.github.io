# AI-Augmented IPCC Reports - Demo Showcase

## Overview
This demo showcases an AI-powered literature synthesis system designed to enhance IPCC (Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change) Working Group 3 reports, with a specific focus on buildings and demand chapters. The system provides interactive visualizations and insights to support climate policy decision-making.

## Focus Areas

### IPCC Working Group 3: Mitigation of Climate Change
**Primary Focus: Buildings and Demand Chapters**

The demo concentrates on Working Group 3's critical areas of:
- **Buildings Sector**: Energy efficiency, sustainable construction, retrofitting
- **Demand Management**: Consumer behavior, service provisioning, lifestyle changes
- **Cross-sectoral Integration**: Synergies between buildings, energy, and demand-side solutions

## Core Features

### 1. Bipartite Network Visualization
- **Paper-Chapter Matching**: Visual representation of research papers mapped to specific IPCC chapters
- **Subset Clarity**: Focused visualization on key papers for enhanced readability
- **Interactive Elements**: Zoom, pan, and filter capabilities for detailed exploration
- **Network Analysis**: Identification of research gaps and consensus areas

### 2. AI-Powered Literature Synthesis
- **Automated Analysis**: Machine learning algorithms for paper classification and relevance scoring
- **Consensus Detection**: Identification of agreement/disagreement in scientific literature
- **Gap Analysis**: Highlighting areas requiring additional research or review
